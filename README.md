This project is a word-guessing game app built in SwiftUI, named *WordGarden-SwiftUI*. The game challenges players to guess hidden words letter by letter, with each incorrect guess reducing the number of remaining attempts. 
Players start with 8 guesses, and visual feedback is provided through a flower image that wilts as incorrect guesses accumulate. 
The game also plays sound effects for correct or incorrect guesses, enhancing the user experience. 
If the player successfully uncovers the word, they progress to the next word; if not, the word is marked as missed. 
Once all words are attempted, the player can restart the game. The app integrates interactive elements, such as a dynamic status message, an animated flower, and buttons to manage gameplay flow, making it an engaging way to practice word guessing and explore SwiftUI features.
